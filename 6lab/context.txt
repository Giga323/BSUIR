One morning, there's the dead jellyfish of a used condom floating in the toilet.
This is how Tyler meets Marla.
I get up to take a leak, and there against the sort of cave paintings of dirt in the toilet bowl is this.
You have to wonder, what do sperm think.
This.
This is the vaginal vault.
What's happening here.
All night long, I dreamed I was humping Marla Singer.
Marla Singer smoking her cigarette.
Marla Singer rolling her eyes.
I wake up alone in my own bed, and the door to Tyler's room is closed.
The door to Tyler's room is never closed.
All night, it was raining.
The shingles on the roof blister, buckle, curl, and the rain comes through and collects on top of the ceiling plaster and drips down through the light fixtures.
When it's raining, we have to pull the fuses.
You don't dare turn on the lights.
The house that Tyler rents, it has three stories and a basement.
We carry around candles.
It has pantries and screened sleeping porches and stained-glass windows on the stairway landing.
There are bay windows with window seats in the parlor.
The baseboard moldings are carved and varnished and eighteen inches high.
The security task force guy explained everything to me.
Baggage handlers can ignore a ticking suitcase.
The security task force guy, he called baggage handlers Throwers.
Modern bombs don't tick.
But a suitcase that vibrates, the baggage handlers, the Throwers, have to call the police.
How I came to live with Tyler is because most airlines have this policy about vibrating baggage.
My flight back from Dulles, I had everything in that one bag.
When you travel a lot, you learn to pack the same for every trip.
Six white shirts. Two black trousers. The bare minimum you need to survive.
Traveling alarm clock. Cordless electric razor. Toothbrush. Six pair underwear. Six pair black socks.
It turns out, my suitcase was vibrating on departure from Dulles, according to the security task force guy, so the police took it off the flight.
Everything was in that bag.
My contact lens stuff. One red tie with blue stripes. One blue tie with red stripes. These are regimental stripes, not club tie stripes. And one solid red tie.
A list of all these things used to hang on the inside of my bedroom door at home.
Home was a condominium on the fifteenth floor of a high-rise, a sort of filing cabinet for widows and young professionals.
The marketing brochure promised a foot of concrete floor, ceiling, and wall between me and any adjacent stereo or turned-up television.
A foot of concrete and air conditioning, you couldn't open the windows so even with maple flooring and dimmer switches, all seventeen hundred airtight feet would smell like the last meal you cooked or your last trip to the bathroom.
Yeah, and there were butcher block countertops and low-voltage track lighting.
Still, a foot of concrete is important when your next-door neighbor lets the battery on her hearing aid go and has to watch her game shows at full blast.
Or when a volcanic blast of burning gas and debris that used to be your living-room set and personal effects blows out your floor-to-ceiling windows and sails down flaming to leave just your condo, only yours, a gutted charred concrete hole in the cliffside of the building.
These things happen.
Everything, including your set of hand-blown green glass dishes with the tiny bubbles and imperfections, little bits of sand, proof they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working indigenous aboriginal peoples of wherever, well, these dishes all get blown out by the blast.
Picture the floor-to-ceiling drapes blown out and flaming to shreds in the hot wind.

Fifteen floors over the city, this stuff comes flaming down like a meteor shower.
Gone.
All my stuff.
My Philips Rack stereo, my kettle drum and gourmet set, the four Henckels knives my sister gave me for my last birthday.
Fifteen floors over the city and my stuff just keeps falling and falling, until you feel like screaming, "Just land somewhere! Just stop falling!"
The candles that used to line the built-in shelves around the fireplace are long gone, melted down into little wax shells around the wicks, thirty minutes of light left on a winter day when you need it the most.
On the drive home, I remember the line in the marketing brochure for my high-rise home: "Live in the comfort of your own sustainable urban development."
